This error occurs when you use a component that expects a specific prop type, but you provide it with a different type. For example, if a component expects a string prop, but you provide it with a number, you might see this error. This can happen in several situations, such as when data is fetched from an API and it's not in the expected format, or when using state management that doesn't properly type the data.
